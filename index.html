        <p>When the lights dim, I know that I am not alone. As reality fades, I brace for the dreams.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="dark.jpg" alt="it is dark" id="day2">
        <p>Gone is the world around me. Darkness permiates my existance. It sticks to my flesh. Binding. Nurturing me.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="_gee.png" alt="vista" id="day3">
        <p>The new world awaits me. Vistas of golden brown spring forth right in front of my eyes. Yet I know. My mind bears a heavy burden.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="_arrive.png" alt="arrival" id="day4">
        <p>Stars. Stars I have never seen. A sky unknown to me. Light from beyond beckons. But before I could approach, they arrived.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="_darker.png" alt="stars fade as they approach" id="day5">
        <p>The stars fade from view. I will never know their solace. Their peace. I calm my body for what I know will happen.</p>

        <p>the end approaches</p>
        <p>the pain climbs</p>
        <p>night envelopes me</p>
        <p>I am one with the sky</p>
